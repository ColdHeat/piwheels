              upgrade pip within the virtual environment with <code>pip install
              pip --upgrade</code>. If not (e.g. in Raspbian Stretch), pip
              should honour your <code>/etc/pip.conf</code> file and use

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>To explicitly use piwheels, simply use the <code>-i</code> or
              <code>--index-url</code> option, for example:</p>

              <pre>$ sudo pip3 install numpy -i https://www.piwheels.org/simple</pre>

              <p>or</p>

              <pre>$ sudo pip3 install numpy --index-url https://www.piwheels.org/simple</pre>

              <p>Alternatively, you can use piwheels as an additional index,
              which will allow pip to fall back to PyPI if the requested
              package (or one of its dependencies) is not available on
              piwheels, by using the <code>--extra-index-url</code> option, for
              example:</p>

              <pre>$ sudo pip3 install numpy --extra-index-url https://www.piwheels.org/simple</pre>

              <p>If your pip is configured to use piwheels, but you want to use

              <code>extra-index-url</code> configuration in
              <code>/etc/pip.conf</code> to avoid piwheels permanently, or you
              can explicitly request PyPI in the installation command, for
              example:</p>

              <pre>$ sudo pip3 install numpy -i https://pypi.python.org/simple</pre>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>Time saved depends on the package requested, and the Raspberry
              Pi model used. Some packages usually require significant build
              time, which is avoided by using piwheels. Many packages are
              usually quite quick to install anyway, and only a small amount of
              time is saved.</p>

            <a href="#" class="accordion-title">How long does it take for a new release
              to become available on piwheels?</a>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>piwheels should notice the registration of a new package or
              version within about 10 seconds. How long it takes for that
              version to be built then depends on two factors:</p>

              <ul>
                <li><em>Available build slaves</em>. At the time of writing,
                  we're working through a big backlog of 3.5 builds so builds
                  may take a few days to appear. Once that backlog is cleared
                  it'll depend on &hellip;
                <li><em>Build time</em>. If the package is pure python it
                  should build within a few seconds and appear very quickly.
                  Alternatively if it's a big chunk of C++ with lots of
                  generics it can take hours to compile (the longest compile
                  time for a successful build is currently over 3 hours).
              </ul>

              <p>So ultimately the time for a new release to appear can be
              anything from about 10 seconds up to several hours (for complex
              to build packages) or several days (when piwheels has a large
              backlog of packages to work through).</p>

              <p>Some packages build differently depending on the tools
              available. For example, if the package <code>matplotlib</code> is
              built with <code>pyqt</code> installed, the wheel will depend on
              the user also having <code>pyqt</code> installed. If it is built
              without <code>pyqt</code>, the user can use
              <code>matplotlib</code> without <code>pyqt</code>.</p>

              <p>First of all: check your pip configuration and confirm that
              piwheels is in fact being used. You should see <code>downloading
              from https://www.piwheels.org</code>.</p>

              <p>If you are definitely using piwheels, it could be that while
              the package you installed was available on piwheels, perhaps one
              of its dependencies is not available, and requires downloading
              from PyPI and building from source.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              <p>While the hardware in Raspberry Pi 1 and Zero is ARMv6, Pi 2
              is ARMv7, Pi 3 is ARMv8, the Raspbian operating system images

              architectures (and are compatible with all Raspberry Pi products
              to date) by operating in ARMv6 userland.</p>

              <p>However, wheels built on a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 are tagged
              <code>armv7l</code>. Since wheels built on a Raspberry Pi 3 will
              work on a Pi 2, 1 or Zero, we simply provide Pi 3-built wheels
              renamed <code>armv6l</code>.</p>

              <p>Some wheels may work on other ARM platforms, but we can't
              guarantee this.  Pure Python wheels will certainly work, but
              there's a much smaller speed increase installing from wheels over
              source distribution.  ARM platform wheels on piwheels are tagged
              <code>armv6l</code> and <code>armv7l</code> but actually both

              smaller speed increase installing from wheels over source
              distribution.  Packages requiring compilation are built for a

              <p>The current PyPI website does not allow ARM wheels to be

              in your <code>~/.pypirc</code> file) but it should be noted that
              wheels built on a Raspberry Pi 3, although tagged
              <code>armv7l</code> are not truly ARMv7, and may be incompatible
              with other ARM platforms. If your package is made exclusively for
              the Raspberry Pi platform, there is no harm in uploading ARM
              wheels to PyPI, and this will speed up the installation for users
              who do not have pip configured to use piwheels.</p>

              <p>If you intend for your package to be installed by users in
              multiple ARM platforms, you may be best not to upload ARM wheels
              to PyPI and instead leave Raspberry Pi users to get a wheel from
              piwheels, and leave other ARM platform users to build from
              source.</p>
