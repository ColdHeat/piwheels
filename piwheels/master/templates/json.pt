        <h2>JSON API</h2>
        <p>piwheels.org provides a JSON API for information about packages we host.</p>

        <h3>Package information</h3>

        <p>Package information can be found at <strong>piwheels.org/project/&lt;package&gt;/json</strong>,
        e.g. <a href="https://www.piwheels.org/project/numpy/json">piwheels.org/project/numpy/json</a>.
        This data includes information about every released version of the package,
        the status of any build attempts made by piwheels, which ABIs and platforms
        we have built files for, and information about these files, including filename,
        filesize, hash, build duration and any apt dependencies.</p>

        <p>The project pages themselves (e.g. <a href="https://www.piwheels.org/project/numpy">piwheels.org/project/numpy</a>)
        are made up from the data in this JSON file, but additional data is available
        to that shown on those pages. It is also useful to be able to access the data
        for a package in a structured way from within a program, as well as the human
        readable method via the project page.</p>

        <p>Example usage from a Python script:</p>

        <pre>import requests

url = "https://www.piwheels.org/project/numpy/json"
package = requests.get(url).json()

for version, info in package.items():
    print(version, info['released'])</pre>

        <pre>import requests

url = "https://www.piwheels.org/project/numpy/json"
package = requests.get(url).json()

def any_files(builds):
    for abi in builds.values():
        if abi['successful_builds']:
            return True

for version, info in package['versions'].items():
    if any_files(info['builds']):
        print(version, ': YES')
    else:
        print(version, ': NO')
</pre>

        <h3>Download stats</h3>

        <p>Basic package download stats (total, and last 30 days) are provided separately
        at <a href="https://www.piwheels.org/packages.json">piwheels.org/packages.json</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Example usage from a Python script:</p>

        <pre>import requests

url = "https://www.piwheels.org/project/packages.json"
packages = requests.get(url).json()
packages = {
    pkg: (d_month, d_all)
    for pkg, d_month, d_all in packages
}

package = 'numpy'
d_month, d_all = packages[package]

print(package, "has had", d_month, "downloads in the last month")
print(package, "has had", d_all, "downloads in total")</pre>
