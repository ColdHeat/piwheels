    When treated as an iterator, this class yields (package, version, timestamp,
    action) tuples indicating new packages or package versions registered on
    PyPI where action is one of 'create', 'source', 'remove', 'yank' or
    'unyank'. A small attempt is made to avoid duplicate reports, but we don't
    attempt to avoid reporting stuff already in the database (it's simpler to
    just start from the beginning of PyPI's log and work through it).

    The iterator only retrieves a small batch of entries at a time as PyPI
    (very sensibly) limits the number of entries in a single query (to 50,000
    at the time of writing), so the instance will need repeated querying to
    retrieve all rows (this works in our favour though as it means there's an
    obvious place to poll for control events between batches).

    :param str pypi_root:
        The web address at which to find the PyPI XML-RPC server.

    :param int serial:
        The serial number of the event from which to start reading.

    :param int retries:
        The number of retries the class may attempt if the HTTP connection
        fails.

    :param int cache_size:
        The size of the internal cache used to attempt to avoid duplicate
        reports.
